# Usage

For each day that will form the entry in the notebook, create a new folder titled the current day (e.g. in the form YYYY-MM-DD).
Inside of the folder, create a markdown file using the template file.

Include all media collected on that day, including photos, videos, recordings, any extra stuff.
