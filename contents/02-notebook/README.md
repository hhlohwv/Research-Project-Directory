# Usage

For each day that will form the entry in the notebook, create a new folder titled the current day (e.g. in the form YYYY-MM-DD).
Inside of the folder, create a markdown file using the template file present in 00-config.

Alternatively, if on windows the script create_entry.bat should be able to be run by double clicking on the icon.
Running this will automatically create a new folder titled with the current date in the form YYYY-MM-DD.
Inside of the folder the script will also copy the template file located in 00-config and rename the file to note.md.
